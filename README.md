# **🐕🐾 Dogs Breed Identification 🐾🐕**

## **🔍 Overview**
This project uses **deep learning models** to accurately identify dog breeds from images. Pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as **Xception, Inception, InceptionResNetV2,** and **MobileNetV2**, were employed. Among these, the **Xception model** achieved the highest accuracy of **91.67%!**

## **📂 Dataset**
The dataset used in this project was sourced from **Kaggle**, containing labeled images of different dog breeds. It has been processed into **training, validation**, and **test** sets.

### **🗂️ Dataset Structure**:
- **Training set**: 🐕‍🦺 Images with breed labels used to train the model.
- **Validation set**: 🧠 Helps fine-tune hyperparameters and avoid overfitting.
- **Test set**: 📊 Used for final performance evaluation of the models.



## **🤖 Models Used**
Several pre-trained CNN architectures were explored for classification:

- **Xception** 🏆 (best accuracy: **91.67%**)
- **Inception** 📈
- **InceptionResNetV2** ⚙️
- **MobileNetV2** 📉

### **🔧 Model Architecture**:
- **Pre-trained CNNs** were modified by adding custom layers for breed classification.
- **Optimization**: Used Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling.
- **Loss Function**: Categorical cross-entropy was applied for multi-class classification.

## **📊 Results**
The **Xception model** outperformed others with an accuracy of **91.67%!** Here are the results of the models:
